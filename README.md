# janitor

just an app that watches the downloads folder for specific files and moves them to a separate directory

## Usage

1. copy `janitor.ini` to your downloads folder
2. edit the ini file to include the files that you want to watch/move
3. run the janitor binary

fun fact: this is my first ever rust app
