# janitor-service

A configurable downloads organizer written in rust

## Usage

1. run the janitor binary
2. a `janitor.toml` file would be created in your downloads directory
3. update the toml file with patterns and destinations - examples entry can be used as reference - patterns are comma separated tuples

fun fact: this is my first ever rust app
